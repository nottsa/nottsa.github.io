## Cancellations by the Centre
The Centre will use reasonable endeavors to ensure that your course takes place and in accordance with your booking. However, the Centre reserves the right to cancel any booking without prior notice and at any time where we believe on reasonable grounds that cancellation is necessary due to unsuitable conditions.

The Centre reserves the right to cancel a course at not less than fourteen (14) days notice where the Centre believes, in itâ€™s reasonable opinion, that there are insufficient numbers for the course to take place.

Where the Centre cancels a course, you will be offered the following options:

* A full refund of the course fee paid; or
* An alternative course on the same date or a different set of dates.
